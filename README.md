Add more files and directories as needed for other configurations.

Credits

These dotfiles are heavily inspired by various sources across the internet, including blog posts, GitHub repositories, and discussions on forums. While many configurations are tailored to my preferences, I owe credit to the broader community for sharing their knowledge and expertise.
